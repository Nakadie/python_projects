def greedy_cow_transport(cows, limit=10):
    """
    Uses a greedy heuristic to determine an allocation of cows that attempts to
    minimize the number of spaceship trips needed to transport all the cows. The
    returned allocation of cows may or may not be optimal.
    The greedy heuristic should follow the following method:
    1. As long as the current trip can fit another cow, add the largest cow that will fit
        to the trip
    2. Once the trip is full, begin a new trip to transport the remaining cows
    Does not mutate the given dictionary of cows.
    Parameters:
    cows - a dictionary of name (string), weight (int) pairs
    limit - weight limit of the spaceship (an int)

    A list of lists, with each inner list containing the names of cows

    Finds the allocation of cows that minimizes the number of spaceship trips

    1. Enumerate all possible ways that the cows can be divided into separate trips
