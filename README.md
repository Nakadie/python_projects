# python_projects
These are my practice projects, puzzles, classwork for python.
Mostly intended for personal reference. 

The code in this repo is from various stages of my development. But I wanted to keep track of my improvement as I went and be able to reference earlier solutions to problems.

My fully developed projects will be pinned on my main page but if you want to see what I have been up to other than that. Feel free to look around. All the projects are in various stages of development.
